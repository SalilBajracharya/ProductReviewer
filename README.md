# Product Reviewer API

## Overview

## Features

- JWT Authentication & Role-based Access Control
- Product listing, filtering, and categorization
- Review submission and rating logic on to [Reviewer, Admin] roles
- CSV report generation for products
- Pagination support for [list] endpoints
- Centralized error/exception logging via Serilog
- Global exception handling middleware
- xUnit and Moq-based unit testing
- FluentResults for all types of response handling

## Tecch Stack

- .NET 9
- Entity Framework Core
- MediatR (CQRS)
- Serilog (file-based logging)
- FluentResults
- xUnit + Moq

## Project Structure

ProductReviewer.Api              # Entry point with controllers and middleware
ProductReviewer.Application      # CQRS queries, commands, DTOs
ProductReviewer.Infrastructure   # EF Core, database context, repositories, services
ProductReviewer.Domain           # Entities and enums (Product, Review, etc.)
ProductReviewer.Test.*           # Unit tests for handlers and services


## Running Locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Set your connection string in `appsettings.json`
3. Run the project with startup project ProductReviewer.API

Swagger UI will be available at: `http://localhost:<port>/swagger`

## Workflow

1. Database Initialization:
    * Database and tables are auto-created on first run using migrations.
    * DbInitializer.cs seeds sample users, products, and a default admin.

2. Default Admin:
    * A default Admin is seeded:
        Username: Super
        Password: MyPassword1!

3. Review Permissions:
    * Only users with Admin or Reviewer roles can add product reviews.
    * Default registered users receive the User role, which cannot post reviews.

4. Role Management:
    * Admins can promote users to Reviewer via the protected endpoint:
    POST /Auth/assign-role (Admin-only access)

5. Flow to Add Reviews:
    * Admin assigns the Reviewer role => user logs in => user can now post reviews.

6. Generate CSV report:
    * All authenticated users can generate product review CSV reports.
    * You can restrict this further using Authorization Policies if needed.

## ðŸ§¾ Notes
- Logging is written to `/Logs/log-<date>.txt` (rotated daily, retained for 7 days)
- All unhandled exceptions are caught and logged via middleware
- Clean separation of concerns between Application, Infrastructure, Domain and API layers
